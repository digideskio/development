not so great, makes difficult to compare, little insight, though pleasant to watch

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44506	
sorry but doesn't work so well.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44485i
my fave so far, fun to play with, has an angle.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44711
not so great. some skill in execution but what to see...

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44474
ah, i can see the work but help; rainbow map, visual metaphors with don't work so well, and all in all nothing to see.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44645
annoyed by that. again I See the work but this is adapting something that doesn't work so well on a dataset that didn't ask anything and at the end of the day: we don't see a thing.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44575
does it work?

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44636
ok for me there's a bunch of stuff not to do here. sorry, because there is some work here.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44527
no. none of the metaphor work. 

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44489
YES! I <3 szucs. here the design works, there is an angle, there is a visual supplement.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44417
very interesting. I like the fact that there is an angle. there are quite a few things that tick me off in the execution but overall a good analysis.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44446
sorry, doesn't work. the chord doesn't show the relation between disease and continent.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44680
does it work?

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44602
striking but legible?

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44561
doesn't work for me sorry.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44339
not so great, so there is a map... which is not so helpful... and the rest is not really an infographic.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44549
don't really understand it or like it.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44522
there are a bunch of problems with this thing.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44367
now that's nice. there is design. there is an angle. there is low legibility but this is by design. I think it drives the user to look deeper.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44521
interesting dashboard, good spatial organization but why oh why those conecharts?

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44617
some nice things here but many problems too.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44608
doesn't work for me: don't get into the aesthetics, can't read or understand.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44497
this is ok I guess.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44669
I was attracted by the aesthetics at first but don't understand it and from up close feel it doesn't work as well.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44314
too simple. you need legend.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44376
I really would like to like it but i can't. colors don't work, not legible, can't see the angle.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44554
works very well, not sure it is on topic, but well designed, well done.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44436
doesn't work so well for me. +1 for the crumpled paper look though.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44378
yes but no. colors, circles, but what do i make of it: nothing.

http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/44455
does it work?



Flights 

http://visualizing.org/full-screen/44513
i quite like it. simple, works well.

http://visualizing.org/full-screen/44459
not bad. not great, but design is here and works fine.

http://visualizing.org/full-screen/44452
annoyed by this, because the idea is great but the execution is quite flawed.

http://visualizing.org/full-screen/44482
nice, more poster than interactive but fine

http://visualizing.org/full-screen/44503
very impressive (not perfect), like that there are versions for win, mac, linux...

http://visualizing.org/full-screen/44533
same as #2: not bad, not great, interactivity works, design choices are so so.

http://visualizing.org/full-screen/44679
not super interactive are we?

http://visualizing.org/full-screen/44495
doesn't seem to be working so well

http://visualizing.org/full-screen/44624
why physical maps, not so impressive

http://visualizing.org/full-screen/44450
very nice, but why center it on belgium? plus map -> graph -> map doesn't work.
